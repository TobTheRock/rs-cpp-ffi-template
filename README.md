# Template: C++ bindings with Rust

## The Cxx crate
Reference: https://cxx.rs/

### Build flow

## CLI example

### Shim library built with Rust 
Built the Rust library with:
```
cargo b --features=build_shim
```
this already builts (with `build.rs`) a static library including the sources generated by `cxx`  and as well those of the shim layer (`src/cpp/deep_thought.cpp`).

Thus we only need to link against this library and include its headers to build the CLI executable using `CMake` (see `cli/CMakeLists.txt`) with:
```
cmake -S cli/ -B target/cli
cmake --build target/cli
```

### Shim library built with CMake/Corrosion 
https://github.com/corrosion-rs/corrosion
```
cargo b
```

```
cmake -S cli/ -B target/cli -DUSE_CORROSION=1
```

### Running the CLI
Just execute
```
./target/cli/deep_thought_cli
```
and prompt your question which `DeepThoughtâ„¢` will gladly answer.
